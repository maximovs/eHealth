A Depth First Tree Traversal is a way of traversing a tree. In this kind of algorithms, nodes are not visited level by level but from top to bottom and then back again.

There are several ways of visiting nodes in this kind of algorithms, for example, inorder, preorder or posorder.

Inorder: first visit my left branch, then myself, then my right branch.

preorder: first visit myself, then my left branch, then my right branch.

posorder: first visit my left branch, then my right branch, then myself.



It is the right way to traverse a BST to search for a value.
